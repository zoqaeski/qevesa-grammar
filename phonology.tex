\subsection{Vowel inventory}
\label{ssec:vowels}

There are twelve distinct vowel phonemes in Qevesa, listed in \cref{tab:vowels}.
These are divided into six long and six short phonemes, differing in length
but not quality.  Long vowels are held approximately twice as long as their
short counterparts.

\begin{table}[h!]\small\capstart
  \begin{tabular}{BFl -c -c -c}
    \toprule
    \SetRowStyle{\bfseries} & Front & Central & Back \\
    \midrule
    Close & i iː y yː &         & u uː \\
    Mid   & e eː      &         & o oː \\
    Open  &           & a aː \\
    \bottomrule
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Qevesa vowel phonemes\label{tab:vowels}}
\end{table}

Although the vowels [e] and [o] are conventionally written using the close-mid
\textsc{ipa} symbols, they are more accurately transcribed as mid vowels
[\textlowering{e}] and [\textlowering{o}].  Syllable-initial /e/ is often
realised as [je], and syllable-initial /o/ may be realised as [wo] in some
dialects.  There are eight diphthongs, /ai ei oi au ua uo ue ui/.

  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Consonants\label{tab:consonants}}
\end{table}

Qevesa possesses twenty-three consonants, excluding allophones, which are
listed in \cref{tab:consonants}.  The features and allophones of each row are
described in more detail below.

Consonantal length is phonemic, so [mata] and [matːa] are distinguished.  In
correct speech, geminate consonants should be articulated and released
separately, although in quick speech they will be pronounced as prolonged.
Geminates may only occur in the middle or at the end of words.


\subsubsection{Nasals}
\label{sssec:nasals}

Qevesa has three nasal consonants: /m \tsb{n} ɲ/.  /\tsb{n}/ is a laminal
denti-alveolar nasal, rather than a true dental nasal.  These consonants are
largely consistent in their realisation, though they may assimilate to the
articulation point of adjacent plosives in clusters. 


\subsubsection{Plosives}
\label{sssec:plosives}

Qevesa has four plosive consonants, spread over four positions (labial,
denti-alveolar, palatal, velar): /p \tsb{t} c k/.  /c/ has a highly variable
pronunciation, varying from [c\tlde cç\tlde tɕ], depending on dialect; the geminate /cː/
is especially prone to being realised as an affricate. 

The plosives may be realised with a slight aspiration when syllable-final. 


\subsubsection{Fricatives}
\label{sssec:fricatives}

Qevesa has nine fricative consonants: /f v θ ð s ʃ x h/.  /v/ and /ð/ are
commonly realised as approximants.  /ɕ/ is an allophone of /ʃ/ that occurs
after palatalised consonants.  Before /i/ or /j/, /x/ and /h/ may be realised
as [ç]; intervocalic and geminate /h/ may be realised as /ɦ/. 


\subsubsection{Affricates}
\label{sssec:affricates}

Qevesa has four affricates: /ts dz tʃ dʒ/.  /ts/ and /tʃ/ are consistently
realised as affricates and behave as though they were a single consonant.  /dz/
and /dʒ/ may be realised as a plain fricatives [z] and [ʒ] when word initial or
preceded by another non-fricative consonant.

%The affricates are affected by palatalisation in a similar manner to the fricatives.


\subsubsection{Liquids and Glides}
\label{sssec:liquids}

Qevesa has two liquid consonants (one lateral and one rhotic) and two glides.

The lateral consonant is the denti-alveolar /l/.  When preceding an /i-/ glide
or /j/, it is realised as [ʎ].  

The rhotic consonant is the alveolar trill /r/, which is often realised as the
tap [ɾ] between vowels.  Immediately adjacent to /s ʃ ʒ/, /r/ is usually
realised as an approximant [ɹ], and after /n ɲ/ it may be realised as [ʒ].
Adjacent to a lateral, the rhotic assimilates such that /rl rl/ are pronounced
[lː].

The glide is the palatal glide /j/, which alternates between [j\tlde ʝ\tlde ʑ].
Initially and intervocalically it is usually pronounced as an approximant, but
when final it may be pronounced as a fricative, especially before a stop or
nasal consonant.  

The fricatives /v/ and /ð/ are also often realised as approximants [ʋ] and [ð̞].  


\subsection{Phonemic Restrictions}
\label{ssec:phonemic_restrictions}

The main limitations on phonemic distribution are found within the context of
consonant clusters.  Any single consonant may appear in onset or coda position,
word-initially, word-medially, or word-finally.  


\subsubsection{Syllable Structure}
\label{sssec:syllables}

Qevesa syllables are strictly (C)V(C)(C).  The rest is \tbw


\subsubsection{Consonant Clusters}
\label{sssec:consonant_clusters}

Qevesa is fairly lenient when it comes to word-internal clusters.  Almost any
combination is permitted, including clusters containing two consonants having
the same point of articulation. 

Initial consonant clusters are not permitted, except for palatal and labial
offglides.  Final clusters may only consist of geminates and the following
clusters: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item /l/ + /p t k s ʃ/: /lp lt lk ls lʃ/
  \item /m n p t c k/ + /s ʃ/: /ms mʃ ns nʃ ɲɕ ps pʃ ts tʃ cç\tlde tɕ ks kʃ/
  \item /s ʃ/ + /p t k/: /sp st sk ʃp ʃt ʃk/
  \item A fricative + affricate at the same point of articulation: /sts ʃtʃ/
  \item /n/ + /t c k/: /nt ɲc nk/
  \item /m/ + /p/ : /mp/
\end{itemize}

Though there are a large number of permissable consonant clusters, their actual
occurrence is fairly infrequent.  Syllable-final clusters are to be avoided
word-internally: VCCV will always be split into VC.CV\@.  Clusters of three or
more consonants are never permitted.

%\pagebreak[2]
The Latin orthography is largely phonemic, albeit not a one-to-one
transliteration of the native script, and makes use of a number of diacritics
and digraphs.  The diacritics indicate the following features:

\begin{description}
  \item[Háček/Caron] The \foreign{háček} or caron indicates a palatalised
    variant.  It is used with \Q{c}, \Q{n}, \Q{s} and \Q{z}, producing \Q{č},
    \Q{ň}, \Q{š} and \Q{ž}  
  \item[Acute] The acute accent is used to indicate a long vowel, and is used
    with \Q{a}, \Q{e}, \Q{i}, \Q{o} and \Q{u} to produce \Q{á}, \Q{é}, \Q{í},
    \Q{ó} and \Q{ú}.  In handwriting, the acute accent is usually written more
    like a macron with an almost horizontal line. 
\end{description}

The digraphs \Q{kh}, \Q{ph} and \Q{th} represent the phonemes /x/, /f/ and /θ/.
These phonemes were originally pronounced as aspirated stops in Common Therasa,
and became fricatives in Qevesa (the corresponding aspirated palatal stop
became the affricate /tʃ/, represented as \Q{č}).  The letter \Q{z} represents
the affricate /dz/.

Geminate consonants are doubled, except for the digraphs which only double the
first consonant.  

%  Although the orthography is largely morphophonemic, a number of phonemes may be written in more than one way:

%  \begin{itemize}
%    %\item Palatalisation is indicated by a following \Q{j}, an i-glide
%    diphthong, or a \foreign{háček} above the vowel.  %/ji/ is represented
%    with \Q{y} or \Q{í} and realised as /\supj iː/.
%    %\item /i-/glides and /j/ soften (palatalise) preceding consonants:
%    therefore /ɕ/ /tɕ/ /\textltailn/ may be represented by \Q{š} \Q{č} \Q{ń}
%    or \Q{si-} \Q{ci-} \Q{ni-} before another vowel.  /\supj e/ \Q{ě} will
%    also cause palatalisation in this manner.
%    %\item /v/ may be realised as an approximant in some situations, and
%    digraphs involving \Q{v} or \Q{f} such as \Q{sf} or \Q{zv} may result in
%    the labiodental fricative being realised as anything between [f] [v] and
%    [ʋ].
%    %\item /iː/ is usually written as \Q{í} except when word-initial, when it
%    is written as \Q{y}.
%  \end{itemize}
