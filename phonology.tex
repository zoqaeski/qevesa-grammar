\subsection{Vowel inventory}
\label{ssec:vowels}

There are ten distinct vowel phonemes in Qevesa, listed in \cref{tab:vowels}.
These are divided into five long and five short phonemes, differing in length
but not quality.  Long vowels are held approximately twice as long as their
short counterparts.

Although the vowels [e] and [o] are conventionally written using the close-mid
\textsc{ipa} symbols, they are more accurately transcribed as mid vowels
[\textlowering{e}] and [\textlowering{o}].  Word-initial /e/ is often realised
as [je], and word-initial /o/ may be realised as [wo] in some dialects.

% The diphthongs consist of /i-/ /-i/ /u-/ and /-u/ glides, as exemplified in
% \cref{tab:diphthongs}.  /i-/ onset diphthongs may cause palatalisation of the
% preceding consonant, and /u-/ onset glides may cause labialisation of the
% preceding consonant.

  \caption{Consonants\label{tab:consonants}}
\end{table}

Qevesa possesses twenty-six consonants, realised as in \cref{tab:consonants}.
Features and allophones of each row are described in more detail below.
Consonants are slightly palatalised before /i/ (and its associated glides).

Consonantal length is phonemic, so [mata] and [matːa] are distinguished.  In
correct speech, geminate consonants should be articulated and released
separately, although in quick speech they will be pronounced as prolonged.
Geminates may only occur in the middle or at the end of words.


\subsubsection{Nasals}
\label{sssec:nasals}

Qevesa has three nasal consonants: /m \tsb{n} ɲ/.  /\tsb{n}/ is a laminal
denti-alveolar nasal, rather than a true dental nasal.  These consonants are
largely consistent in their realisation, though they may assimilate to the
articulation point of adjacent plosives in clusters. 

The velar nasal [ŋ] is an allophone of /\tsb{n} ɲ/ before /k/.


\subsubsection{Plosives}
\label{sssec:plosives}

Qevesa has four plosive consonants.  These are spread over four positions
(labial, denti-alveolar, palatal, velar); voice is not distinguished: /p
\tsb{t} c k/.  The plosives are often realised with a slight aspiration when
syllable-final; /c/ may become an affricate [cç], especially when geminated.    

%The plosive consonants may be palatalised to [p\supj{} \tsb{t\supj} cç k\supj].


\subsubsection{Fricatives}
\label{sssec:fricatives}

Qevesa has nine fricative consonants: /f v θ ð s ʃ ç x h/.  /v/ and /ð/ are
commonly realised as approximants.  Before /i/ or /j/, /x/ and /h/ may be
realised as [ç]; intervocalic and geminate /h/ may be realised as /ɦ/. 

%  Palatalisation affects the fricatives in a variety of way: 
% 
%  \begin{itemize} \item /f/ palatalises to [f\supj]; \item /θ/ palatalises to
%  [θ\supj]; %\item /θ/ palatalises to [\tsb{s\supj}]; \item /s/ palatalises to
%  [s\supj] \item /ʃ/ palatalise to [ɕ]; \item /ʋ/ and /ð/ reduce to [j]; and,
%  \item /x/ palatalises to [ç]; \end{itemize}


\subsubsection{Affricates}
\label{sssec:affricates}

Qevesa has four affricates: /ts dz tʃ dʒ/.  /ts/ and /tʃ/ are consistently
realised as affricates and behave as though they were a single consonant.  /dz/
and /dʒ/ may be realised as a plain fricatives [z] and [ʒ] when word initial or
preceded by another non-fricative consonant.

%The affricates are affected by palatalisation in a similar manner to the fricatives.


\subsubsection{Liquids and Glides}
\label{sssec:liquids}

Qevesa has two liquid consonants (one lateral and one rhotic) and two to four
glides.

The lateral consonant is the denti-alveolar /l/.  When preceding an /i-/ glide
or /j/, it is realised as [ʎ].  %An allophone of /l/ is [ɬ] that occurs only
% in some clusters, such as /tl/.

The rhotic consonant is the alveolar trill /r/.  It may be realised as a tap
[ɾ] when intervocalic.  
%Palatalised /r/ is realised as [ɾj].

The glide is the palatal glide /j/.  This shows little allophonic variation,
tending to induce allophonic changes in other consonants.  The fricatives /v/
and /ð/ are often realised as approximants.  


\subsection{Phonemic Restrictions}
\label{ssec:phonemic_restrictions}

The main limitations on phonemic distribution are found within the context of
consonant clusters.  Any single consonant may appear in onset or coda position,
word-initially, word-medially, or word-finally.  


\subsubsection{Syllable Structure}
\label{sssec:syllables}

Qevesa syllables are strictly (C)V(C)(C).  The rest is \tbw


\subsubsection{Consonant Clusters}
\label{sssec:consonant_clusters}

Qevesa is fairly lenient when it comes to word-internal clusters.  Almost any
combination is permitted, including clusters containing two consonants having
the same point of articulation. 

Initial consonant clusters are not permitted, except for palatal and labial
offglides.  Final clusters may only consist of geminates and the following
clusters: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item /l/ + /p t k s ʃ/: /lp lt lk ls lʃ/
  \item /m n p t c k/ + /s ʃ/: [ms mʃ ns nʃ ɲç ps pʃ ts tʃ cç ks kʃ]
  \item /s ʃ/ + a plosive: [sp st çc sk ʃp ʃt ʃk]
  \item A fricative + affricate at the same point of articulation: [sts ʃtʃ]
  \item /n/ + /t c k/: [nt ɲç nk]
  \item /m/ + /p/ : [mp]
\end{itemize}

Though there are a large number of permissable consonant clusters, their actual
occurrence is fairly infrequent.  Syllable-final clusters are to be avoided
word-internally: VCCV will always be split into VC.CV\@.  Clusters of three or
more consonants are never permitted.

%\pagebreak[2]
The Latin orthography is largely phonemic, and makes use of a number of
diacritics and digraphs.  The diacritics indicate the following features:

\begin{description}
  \item[Háček/Caron] The \foreign{háček} or caron indicates a palatalised
    variant.  It is used with \Q{c}, \Q{n}, \Q{s} and \Q{z}, producing \Q{č},
    \Q{ň}, \Q{š} and \Q{ž}  
  \item[Acute] The acute accent is used to indicate a long vowel, and is used
    with \Q{a}, \Q{e}, \Q{i}, \Q{o} and \Q{u} to produce \Q{á}, \Q{é}, \Q{í},
    \Q{ó} and \Q{ú}.  In handwriting, the acute accent is usually written more
    like a macron with an almost horizontal line. 
\end{description}

The digraphs \Q{ch}, \Q{kh}, \Q{ph} and \Q{th} represent the phonemes /ç/, /x/, /f/ and
/θ/.  These phonemes were originally pronounced as aspirated stops in Common
Therasa, and became fricatives in Qevesa.  The letter \Q{z} represents the
affricate /dz/.

Geminate consonants are doubled, except for the digraphs which only double the
first consonant.  

%  Although the orthography is largely morphophonemic, a number of phonemes may be written in more than one way:

%  \begin{itemize}
%    %\item Palatalisation is indicated by a following \Q{j}, an i-glide diphthong, or a \foreign{háček} above the vowel.  %/ji/ is represented with \Q{y} or \Q{í} and realised as /\supj iː/.
%    %\item /i-/glides and /j/ soften (palatalise) preceding consonants: therefore /ɕ/ /tɕ/ /\textltailn/ may be represented by \Q{š} \Q{č} \Q{ń} or \Q{si-} \Q{ci-} \Q{ni-} before another vowel.  /\supj e/ \Q{ě} will also cause palatalisation in this manner.
%    %\item /v/ may be realised as an approximant in some situations, and digraphs involving \Q{v} or \Q{f} such as \Q{sf} or \Q{zv} may result in the labiodental fricative being realised as anything between [f] [v] and [ʋ].
%    %\item /iː/ is usually written as \Q{í} except when word-initial, when it is written as \Q{y}.
%  \end{itemize}
