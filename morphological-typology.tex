  \chapter{Morphological Typology}
  \label{ch:morphological_typology}

  % I REALLY REALLY don't like this paragraph
  % Morphology pertains to the organisation, rules, and processes concerning
  % meaningful units of language, whether they be words themselves, or parts of
  % words, such as affixes of various sorts.  The minimal meaningful unit of
  % morphological processes is the morpheme; words and phrases are all
  % constructed from morphemes in successive stages.

  Qevesa morphology differs quite significantly from English.  The lexemes, or
  roots, are based around discontinuous clusters of two to five consonantal
  phonemes.  These roots interlock with patterns of vowels (and sometimes other
  consonants) to form words or word stems.

  \begin{exe}
    \ex \emph{EXAMPLE}
  \end{exe}

  These words, or word stems, can be further modified by the addition of
  inflexional affixes, such as suffixes, prefixes, and occasionally infixes.
  The triliteral root represents the semantic field or abstract concept; the
  patterns represent specific lexical or inflectional derivations.  Both roots
  and patterns are bound morphemes, each conveying specific and essential types
  of information.  Neither can exist independently because both are abstract
  mental representations. 

  Many triliteral roots may have biliteral origins. 

%  \section{Definition of Root}
%  \label{sec:mt_definition_of_root}
%
%  A root is a relatively invariable discontinuous bound morpheme, represented
%  by two to five phonemes in a certain order, which interlocks with a pattern
%  to form a stem, and which has lexical meaning.  The root morpheme is
%  discontinuous because vowels can be interspersed between the consonants;
%  however, the consonants of a root must always be present and in the same
%  sequence.  The usual number of consonants in a Qevesa root is three; however,
%  there are also two-consonantal (biliteral), four-consonantal (quadriliteral)
%  and five-consonantal (quinquiliteral), although the latter are extremely
%  rare.  Quadriliteral and quinquiliteral roots always contain a consonant
%  cluster as a root phoneme that cannot be split, and as a result, their
%  derivation into variant root forms tends to be highly irregular.
%
%  The root is said to contain lexical meaning because it communicates the idea
%  of a real-world concept.  It is useful to consider the root as denoting a
%  semantic field because it is within that field that actual words come into
%  existence.  The exact number of lexical roots in Qevesa ranges from two- to
%  three thousand; phonologically there are many times that number of
%  permissable roots.  This is complicated by the fact that some roots contain
%  bound consonant clusters, and certain consonants may be elided or induce
%  other phonological phenomena.

%  \subsection{Irregular Roots}
%  \label{ssec:mt_irregular_roots}

%  Although most roots are highly regular, there are a number of roots whose
%  morphology is slightly irregular, due to the presence of certain consonants
%  in certain positions. 
%  The consonants that most commonly cause irregularities are ⟨h⟩ and ⟨j⟩, but
%  ⟨v⟩ and ⟨d⟩ may also behave irregularly in some verbs. 
%  The general rules are as follows:

%  \begin{itemize}
%    \item When ⟨h⟩ occurs in the coda positon of a syllable, it induces
%    lengthening of the preceding vowel, and is elided in both the spoken and
%    written form.
%    \item Clusters where ⟨j⟩ is the second consonant result in the
%    palatalisation of the preceding consonant, and syllable-final ⟨j⟩ results
%    in the development of diphthongs.  The written form retains ⟨j⟩ in all
%    positions.
%    \item Less frequently, ⟨v⟩ is pronounced /f/ when preceding another
%    consonant, and is weakly voiced when word-final; and ⟨d⟩ is only
%    pronounced when not preceding another consonant.  When it follows another
%    consonant, it is typically pronounced /θ/.
%  \end{itemize}

%  \section{Definition of Pattern}
%  \label{sec:mt_definition_of_pattern}
%
%  A pattern is a bound and often discontinuous morpheme consisting of a
%  sequence of one or more vowels and slots for root phonemes, which either
%  alone or in conjunction with other affixes, interlocks with a root to form a
%  stem, and which generally has a grammatical meaning.  The pattern is
%  discontinuous because it intersperses itself among the root consonants, and
%  can be considered as a type of template onto which different roots can be
%  mapped.  The derivational affixes include the use of consonants that mark
%  grammatical functions, and	these consonants may be used as suffixes,
%  prefixes, or infixes.  A further component of pattern marking is the
%  gemination or lengthening of existing or already-inserted consonants or
%  vowels.
%
%  Patterns are said to contain grammatical meaning because they signify
%  grammatical or language-internal information; that is, they distinguish word
%  types such as verbal forms, nominal forms, and adjectival forms.  They can
%  also signify very specific information about subclasses of the basic word
%  types, such as aspect, number, and case.
%
%  \subsection{Transfix positions}
%  \label{ssec:mt_transfix_positions}
%
%  To aid in the description of the patterns or transfixes used to form base
%  stems of verbs, nouns, and adjectives, the positions within a root are
%  labeled as follows: the three consonants are referred to as C\sub1, C\sub2,
%  C\sub3, and the positions adjacent to them are P\sub0, P\sub{12}, P\sub{23},
%  P\sub4.  However, most transfix patterns consist of two or three
%  discontinuous vowel sequences, which may consist of short or long vowels, or
%  diphthongs.  These are referred to as V\sub1, V\sub2 and V\sub3. 

  \section{Dictionary Ordering}
  \label{sec:mt_dictionary_ordering}

  Qevesa dictionaries are sorted by lexical root and not spelling.  Instead of
  relying on the exact orthography of a word, Qevesa dictionaries are organised
  by the root or consonant core of a word, providing under that entry every
  word derived from that particular lexical root.  In this regard, a Qevesa
  dictionary is more akin to a thesaurus, locating all possible variations of a
  semantic concept under a single entry.

  \section{Other Lexical Types}
  \label{sec:mt_other_lexical_types}

  Other word formation processes in Qevesa include compounding and solid stems.

  \subsection{Compounding}
  \label{ssec:mt_morph_compounding}

  Compounding is the second-most common means of word formation.  There are
  several variations on compounding: roots (and patterns) may be concatenated
  to form new roots of more consonants; stems may be concatenated to construct
  new meanings; and words may be strung together as phrases to introduce
  variations on a theme.

  Some lexical roots consist of solid stems; that is, they possess inherent
  vowels and generally cannot be reduced into the root-pattern paradigm.  Such
  words fall into one of four categories: pronouns, function words, irregular
  stems, or loan words.  The latter category is fairly sparse, as Qevesa tends
  to rely on substitution of terms, calquing or coinage of new terms.
  Sometimes, a loan word may be reanalysed as a root, often with an inherent
  vowel pattern.

  \section{Head/Dependent Marking}
  \label{sec:mt_head_dependent_marking}

  Qevesa tends towards dependent marking, although it also exhibits cases of head-marking.

% by inserting vowels or consonants, and adding transfixes, suffixes, prefixes
% or infixes.  The vast majority of roots are triliteral, or formed from three
% consonants, although two-~and four-~consonant roots also exist.  These roots
% are categorised into morphological classes determined by the number of
% consonants and the specific phonemes that comprise the root.

%  \section{Morphological Processes}
%  \label{sec:mt_morphological_processes}

%  \subsection{Transfixation}
%  \label{ssec:mt_transfixation}

% As a language based on triliteral roots, a large proportion of the
% grammatical marking is done by insertion of discontinuous vowel patterns.
% These transfixes are primarily used to indicate verbal aspects and
% grammatical categories.

% \label{ssec:mt_suffixation}
 
% The second most productive morphological process is suffixation.  Almost all
% other grammatical marking is done by addition of largely agglutinative
% suffixes.
