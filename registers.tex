  \section{Honorifics}
  \label{sec:reg_honorifics}

  \emph{How should honorifics and polite speech be encoded? How important is it?}

  % Plain -vs- Polite form: polite adds -m√°s
  % Humble speech uses a different set of verbal conjugations, in which the verb is reduced to an auxiliary and its place occupied by a honorific verb.
