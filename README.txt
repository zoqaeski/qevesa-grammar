These are the LaTeX files for my Qevesa grammar.  It's a work in progress and
not ready to be released yet, but I wanted a remote repo to upload it to while
I work on it.  The code will almost certainly be rebased without warning so I'd
recommend against forking it (not that I can imagine why anyone would want to).  

That being said, I'm stamping it with a CC BY-NC-SA license[1].  If you'd like
to use the conlang in a commercial publication, please get in touch and we can
work something out, especially if the CC license may pose an issue.
