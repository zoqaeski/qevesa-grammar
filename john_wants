Qevesa uses the volitive mood on the main verb to express intangible desires, hopes or wishes.


[i]John wants to eat the cake.[/i]
[b]Johna pilataş nulisamir.[/b]
John-a pilat-aş nulis-am-ir
[size=85]John-NOM cake-ACC eat.IMPF-3SG;ERG-VOL[/size]

“cake” is added as an argument of the verb, in the accusative case to indicate it is the patient. Note that if emphasis were to be placed on the cake (say, for example, John wanted to eat cake, and not something else), “cake” would be raised to topic, and the associated topical agreement would be marked on the verb:

[i]It is cake that John wants to eat.[/i]
[b]Pilata Johnam nulisňoşir.[/b]
Pilat-a John-am nulis-ňoş-ir

[i]John wants Martin to eat the cake.[/i]
[b]Johna Martinam pilataş nulisil aş ruvilamu.[/b]
John-a Martin-am pilat-aş nulis-il aş ruvil-am-u
[size=85]John-NOM Martin-ERG cake-ACC eat.IMPF-IRR REL.ACC want.IMPF-3SG;ERG-IND[/size]

“Martin eats cake” is treated as a relative clause, and the object of “John wants...”

[i]John wants Martin to eat the cake.[/i]
[b]Martinam pilataş nulisil a Johnam ruvilaşu.[/b]
Martin-am pilat-aş nulis-il a John-am ruvil-aş-u
[size=85]Martin-ERG cake-ACC eat.IMPF-IRR REL.NOM John-ERG want.IMPF-3SG;ACC-IND[/size]


[i]John asked Martin to go early.[/i]
[b]Johna Martinam qeinnuovöżi kinutoła aş kirotamu.[/b]

[size=85]John-NOM Martin-ERG early-ADV go.INCH-PREC REL.ACC request.PFV-3SG;ERG-IND[/size]

“Martin goes early” is treated as a relative clause, and Martin is considered the agent of the verb “to go”. Furthermore, as Martin’s leaving is a request, “to go” is in the precative mood.

I can’t stop thinking about that girl.
