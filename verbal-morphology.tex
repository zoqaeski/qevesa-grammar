  \section{Features}
  \label{sec:vm_features}

  The consonantal root patterns in Qevesa are used to form basic morphological
  paradigms.  Qevesa verbs are highly inflected, indicating tense and aspect by
  transfix patterns; topical agreement and modality are marked by agglutinative
  suffixes.  All other constructions, are indicated by periphrasis or syntax.

  The stem consists of the root and zero or more derivational affixes conjugated to a particular aspect. 

  \section{Verb Root Forms}
  \label{sec:vm_root_forms}

  Although the arrangement of consonants in a root is generally fixed, there
  are regular processes to derive subtle semantic variations on the meaning of
  the root, such as causatives and reflexives.  These root variants are called
  forms, or \qevesa{???} (“constructions”), from the root \qevesa{mukut}
  (“build, construct”).  There are five primary forms, numbered I–V; these are
  listed in \cref{tab:vm_root_forms}.

  \begin{table}[htpb]\small\capstart
    \begin{tabular}{>{\bfseries}Fl -l}
      \toprule
      \SetRowStyle{\bfseries} Form & Pattern \\

      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Verb root forms\label{tab:vm_root_forms}}
  \end{table}

  \subsection{Form I}
  \label{ssec:vm_verb_form_i}

  Form I is the most common consonantal root form, containing no preformative
  affixes or pairing of consonants as occurs in the other forms.  It is
  typically the closest indicator to the lexical meaning of the root, and
  although it has no particular semantic function associated with it, verbs in
  Form I are often transitive.


  \subsection{Form II: Intensive}
  \label{ssec:vm_form_ii}

  Form II is the intensive stem.  It typically indicates an intensive,
  frequentative or causative meaning, and may also be used to form transitive
  verbs from intransitive roots.
   
%   Form II roots include:
%   - [i]CuCCuC[/i]
%   - [i]puhhut[/i] “shout”
%   - [i]murrú[/i] (*[i]murruh[/i]) “watch”
%   - [i]thuvvur[/i] “shatter”
   
  \subsection{Form III: Causative}
  \label{ssec:vm_form_iii}

   Form III is commonly known as the causative stem.  Its most common function
   is causative; it may also convert transitive verbs into ditransitive ones.
   It can also have a causative meaning on verbs whose Form 1 root is
   intransitive, and for some verbs, may convey an assistive or factitive
   meaning.
   
%   Form III roots include:
%   - [i]CuCCu[/i] 
%   - [i]kupšu[/i] “feed”
%   - [i]turmu[/i] “dictate”
%   - [i]murru[/i] “show”
%   - [i]thuvru[/i] “cause to break”
%   
  \subsection{Form VI: Reciprocal}
  \label{ssec:vm_form_vi}

   Form VI is commonly known as the reciprocal stem.  It commonly conveys
   meanings of a reciprocal or reflexive nature, and is oen used to create
   verbs denoting social interactions. 
   
%   Form VI roots include:
%   - [i]miCCuCu[/i]
%   - [i]mephutu[/i] “converse”
%   - [i]metrumu[/i] “correspond”
%   
  \subsection{Form V: Reciprocal Causative}
  \label{ssec:vm_form_v}

   Form V is the reciprocal causative stem, so called for historical reasons as
   it also includes a number of other intransitive meanings.  It is subject to
   much unpredictable metaphorical and semantic and dri, so actual meanings
   may vary quite a lot from the Form 1 verb.  True reflexives account for only
   a portion of the verbs in this form.  Its main functions are:
%   
%   - Forming reflexives from transitive roots - Forming verbs denoting
%   accompaniment - Forming autoreflexive verbs, that is, intransitive actions
%   performed on one’s body[/list]
%   
%   Form V roots include: - [i]taCuCCu[/i]

  \section{The Infinitive}
  \label{sec:vm_infinitive}

  The infinitive verb is the citation form of the verb, as well as the
  non-finite form used in constructions involving an auxiliary verb.  It is
  marked by the patterns \qevesa{C\sub1{u}C\sub2{u}C\sub3}.

  \section{Conjugation}
  \label{sec:vm_conjugation}

  Qevesa is a highly synthetic language, and verbs are conjugated to indicate
  aspect, tense, topical agreement, and mood.  The conjugated form of the verb
  is as follows:

  \begin{exe}
    \ex\label{exe:vm_conjugation} \textit{stem}\bs\textsc{aspect-mood-topic}
  \end{exe}

  \subsection{Aspect and Tense}
  \label{ssec:vm_aspect_tense}
  
%  Qevesa verbal morphology is structured around a two-by-three contrast of two
%  aspects, perfective and imperfective, and three tenses, present, past and
%  future.  There are also two imperatives, one for each aspect, which are not
%  marked for tense.  These are marked by a series of ten transfix patterns, as
%  shown in \cref{tab:vm_tense-aspect_relations}. 
  
  Qevesa verbal morphology primarily indicates aspect rather than tense.  There
  are seven aspectual paradigms, each marked with a transfix pattern.  These
  are given in \cref{tab:vm_aspect_patterns}.

  \end{table}


  \subsubsection{Perfective}
  \label{vm:sssec_perfective}

  The perfective aspect indicate activities viewed as a single whole.
  It is typically used to speak of singular events completed in the past, but
  may also be used to speak of actions without internal structure.

  % I wrote / I have written

  \subsubsection{Momentane}
  \label{vm:sssec_momentane}

  The momentane aspect indicates brief single-time activities or states.

  % A bolt of lighting struck the tree.
  % The mouse squeaked.

  \subsubsection{Progressive}
  \label{vm:sssec_progressive}

  The progressive aspect indicates ongoing actions with a change of state.  It
  may also be used to describe intermittent actions.

  % I am putting on clothes.
  % I am hanging the painting on the wall.
  % It is raining in Kirua:  Kiruazia pašurat.

  \subsubsection{Durative}
  \label{vm:sssec_durative}

  The durative aspect indicates ongoing actions without a change of state, or actions which last some time.

  % I am wearing clothes.
  % The picture is hanging on the wall.

  \subsubsection{Habitual}
  \label{vm:sssec_habitual}

  The habitual aspect indicates actions that occur habitually.  Like the
  progressive, it may also describe intermittent actions, but in a general
  sense.  It can also be used as a general imperfective aspect, without the
  implication on continuous actions or states like the progressive and durative
  aspects. 

  % I walk to work (every day).
  % It is very windy on the plains.

  \subsubsection{Inchoative}
  \label{vm:sssec_inchoative}

  The inchoative aspect emphasises the beginning of an activity or state.

  % She stated walking.
  
  \subsubsection{Cessative}
  \label{vm:sssec_cessative}

  The cessative aspect emphasises the ending of an activity or state.

  % He finished writing.
  
%  \newpage
  \subsubsection{The Imperatives}
  \label{sssec:vm_imperatives}
  
  Qevesa possesses two imperatives, one for each aspect.  

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item The \textbf{perfective} is used for single complete actions. 
    \item The \textbf{imperfective} is used for continuous or otherwise incomplete actions. 
  \end{itemize*}

  The transfix patterns for this series are listed in \cref{tab:vm_imperative_series}.

  \subsection{Modality}
  \label{ssec:vm_modality}

  Qevesa predominantly indicates modality by means of suffixes, with the
  exception of the imperatives described in \cref{sssec:vm_imperatives}.
  There are five synthetic moods: indicative, mirative, conditional, optative
  and potential.  These are listed in \cref{tab:vm_modal_suffixes}; the
  left column indicates suffixes that follow a consonant, and the right column
  suffixes that follow a vowel.
  
  \begin{table}[htpb]\small\capstart
      \begin{tabular}{>{\bfseries}Fl->{\scshape}l -l}
        \toprule
        \multicolumn{2}{fc}{\SetRowStyle{\bfseries}Mood} & Suffix \\
        \midrule
        Indicative  & \acs{ind}  & -∅   \\
        Mirative    & \acs{mir}  & -ine \\
        Conditional & \acs{cond} & -ise \\
        Optative    & \acs{opt}  & -ite \\
        Potential   & \acs{pot}  & -ir \\
        \bottomrule
      \end{tabular}
      \caption{Verbal mood suffixes\label{tab:vm_modal_suffixes}}
  \end{table}

  The \emph{indicative} mood is used for factual statements and positive
  beliefs, and as such is the default mood.  It is marked with a null morpheme. 

  The \emph{mirative} mood is used to express surprise and also doubt, irony,
  sarcasm, etc.  It is used to express statements contrary to the speaker’s
  expectations or state of mind.

  The \emph{conditional} mood is used to speak of an event whose realization is dependent upon another condition. 

  The \emph{optative} mood is used to express hopes, wishes and desires.

  The \emph{potential} mood indicates that, in the opinion of the speaker, the
  action or occurrence is considered likely.  It can also be used to express
  that one has the ability to do something.
  

  \subsection{Topical Agreement}
  \label{ssec:vm_topical_agreement}

  Many of the languages in the ??? family, which includes Therasa and its
  descendants, employ some variant on an active-stative morphosyntactic
  alignment.  Verbs in Qevesa and related languages are marked for topic, which
  may be the agent, patient or some oblique noun phrase, irrespective of
  valency of the verb.  This is hypothesised to be a remnant of a system of
  polypersonal agreement which collapsed into a single suffix that indicated
  the most important element in the clause. 

  Nouns are marked with a corresponding \emph{focal case}\footnotemark{} which
  serves to indicate the topic of the clause.  The topic markers on the verb
  therefore indicate the role of the topical noun.  Syntax also plays a role:
  nouns in the focal case are always the first element in a clause.
  \footnotetext{See \cref{nm_focal_case} for more details}

  The suffixes for topical agreement are given in \cref{tab:vm_topical_agreement}.

  \begin{table}[htpb]\small\capstart
    \begin{tabularx}{0.625 \textwidth}{>{\bfseries}Fl>{\scshape}l *{3}{f}}
      \toprule
      \multicolumn{2}{-c}{\SetRowStyle{\bfseries}} & Nominative & Absolutive & Oblique \tnl
      \SetRowStyle{\scshape} & & \acs{nom} & \acs{abs} & \acs{obl} \tnl
      \midrule
      Animate   & \acs{anim}   & -(a)m & -(a)š & -(a)t  \tnl
      Inanimate & \acs{inanim} &       & -(o)š & -(o)t  \tnl
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabularx}
    \caption{Topical agreement\label{tab:vm_topical_agreement}}
  \end{table}

  \subsubsection{Nominative Topic}
  \label{sssec:vm_nom_topic}

  An nominative topic indicates that the noun phrase in the focal case is the
  voluntary experiencer of an intransitive verb or the agent of a transitive
  verb.  Generally only animate nouns may be agents; to describe an action
  involving an inanimate noun as agent, a construction using the oblique topic
  and the instrumental case is used instead. 

  \subsubsection{Absolutive Topic}
  \label{sssec:vm_abs_topic}

  An absolutive topic indicates that the noun phrase in the focal case is the
  involuntary experiencer of an intransitive verb; the patient of a transitive
  verb; and the recipient of a ditransitive verb.  Only animate nouns may be
  voluntary agents of intransitive verbs; inanimate nouns are always marked as
  involuntary experiencers of intransitive verbs.  Furthermore, some
  intransitive verbs are always involuntary. 

  \subsubsection{Oblique Topic}
  \label{sssec:vm_obl_topic}

  An oblique topic indicates that the noun phrase in the focal case is something
  other than the agent or patient of a transitive verb.  For ditransitive verbs
  it normally indicates the theme or direct object.

  Another common use of the oblique topic is to express an inanimate agent,
  with the topic noun also being marked with the instrumental case.

  \section{Auxiliary Verbs}
  \label{sec:vm_auxiliary}
  
  Auxiliary verbs are used to form periphrastic constructions not covered by
  the synthetic forms described above.  The auxiliary verb takes the
  conjugations of the main verb, which precedes it in the infinitive.  

  \subsection{The Copula}
  \label{ssec:vm_copula}

  The most commonly used auxiliary verb is the copula \qevesa{jupu}, which is
  used to form a variety of constructions.  It is unique in that it is the only
  verb that does not consist of a multi-consonant root, though it conjugates
  similarly.  The conjugated forms of the copula are listed in \cref{tab:vm_copula}.

  \begin{table}[htpb]\small\capstart
    \begin{tabular}{>{\bfseries}Fl >{\scshape}l -l -l -l -l -l}
      \toprule
      \multicolumn{2}{Fc}{\SetRowStyle{\bfseries}Aspect} & \multicolumn{5}{-c}{Mood} \\
      \SetRowStyle{\scshape} & & ind & mir & cond & opt & pot \\
      \midrule
      Perfective  & \acs{perf} & jupa & jupane & jupaisi & jupaite & jupar \\
      Momentane   & \acs{momt} & jupi & jupine & jupísi & jupíte & jupir \\
      Progressive & \acs{prog} & japu & japune & japuisi & japuite & japur \\
      Durative    & \acs{dur}  & japo & japone & japoisi & japoite & japor \\
      Habitual    & \acs{hab}  & jopu & jopuna & jopuisi & jopuite & jopur \\
      Inchoative  & \acs{inch} & jopa & jopana & jopaisi & jopaite & jopar \\
      Cessative   & \acs{cess} & jopi & jopina & jopísi  & jopíte  & jopir \\
      \bottomrule
    \end{tabular}
    \caption{Conjugation of the copula \label{tab:vm_copula}}
  \end{table}

  The modal suffixes on the copula are slightly different, but the suffixes for
  topical agreement (see \cref{ssec:vm_topical_agreement}) are the same.  By
  itself, the copula functions as an existential verb.

%  \begin{exe}
%    \ex \qevesa{A thauka sošima jem en nutul jopirat.}
%    \glll A= thauka sošim-a jem en nutul jopi-r-at\\
%    \textsc{def=} \textsc{dist.anim} girl\textsc{-foc} \textsc{1sg.nom} \textsc{neg} think\bs\textsc{inf} \textsc{cop\bs cess-pot-obl}\\
%    {the} {that} {girl} {I} {not} {think} {can stop}\\
%    \glt I cannot stop thinking about that girl.
%  \end{exe}

  \subsection{Negation}
  \label{ssec:vm_negation}

  Verbs in Qevesa are negated by using a combination of the copula as an
  auxiliary verb and the negative particle \qevesa{en}, which precedes both.
  The main verb appears in the infinitive, with the copula taking its
  inflections, as in a standard auxiliary construction.  If the verb is already
  part of an auxiliary construction, the negation particle precedes this. 



  % Peter-FOC doctor-ABS COP\HAB.
  % Peter is a doctor.

  % Peter-a doctor-el COP\HAB-OPT.
  % Peter wants to become a doctor.
  % 

%  \subsection{Evidentiality}
%  \label{ssec:vm_evidentiality}

%  Evidentiality may also be expressed by means of auxiliary verbs.  Qevesa
%  possesses a set of auxiliary verbs which distinguish four degrees of
%  evidentiality: witness, reportative, inferential, and assumptive. 

%  All of the roots of the evidential auxiliaries are also verbs in their own
%  right.  However, they conjugate as Form VIII verbs, with some slightly
%  irregular pattern forms.  Their conjugation is given in
%  \cref{tab:vm_evidentiality_conjugation}.

%  \subsubsection{Witness}
%  \label{sssec:vm_evd_witness}

%  The witness degree of evidentiality is denoted by the verb \qevesa{murru},
%  meaning ‘to see’.  It is used when the speaker was a witness to the event.

%  \subsubsection{Reportative}
%  \label{sssec:vm_evd_reportative}

%  The reportative degree of evidentiality is denoted by the verb
%  \qevesa{łukšu}, which has the same consonantal root as the verb
%  \qevesa{łukuš} ‘to hear (speech)’.

%  \subsubsection{Inferential}
%  \label{sssec:vm_evd_inferential}

%  The inferential degree of evidentiality is denoted by the verb
%  \qevesa{kučtu}.  It is used when the speaker infers that the event occurred
%  but was not a witness.

%  \subsubsection{Assumptive}
%  \label{sssec:vm_evd_assumption}

%  The assumption degree of evidentiality is denoted by the verb
%  \qevesa{quspu}.  It is used when the speaker is making an assumption about
%  the occurrence of the event.

  \newpage
  \section{Irregular Verbs}
  \label{sec:vm_irregular}

  Qevesa verbal morphology is in general highly regular.  However, due to sound
  changes from Therasa, a number of formerly regular roots have developed
  irregular conjugations, outlined in the sections below.  In the tables, the
  following convensions apply: 

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item C = consonant
    \item P = plosive consonant
    \item H = aspirated plosive
    \item F = fricative, corresponding to the aspirated plosives
    \item K = other consonant
    \item A = vowel
    \item : = length marker
    \item lowercase letters indicate specific phonemes, given in \textsc{ipa}
    \item letters with subscripts refer to root consonants
  \end{itemize*}
  
  %uppercase letters indicate phoneme types (C =
  %consonant, P = plosive, H = *aspirated plosive, F = non-sibilant fricative, S
  %= other fricative, A = vowel); and lowercase letters indicate specific phonemes.

  \subsection{Soft Roots}
  \label{ssec:vm_soft_roots}

  Soft roots are those roots which have /h/ in one or more positions.  This causes the following sound changes:

  \begin{itemize*}
    \item A word-final /h/ induces lengthening of the previous vowel.  Suffixes
      that follow are usually vowel-final.
    \item A /h/ following an unvoiced plosive causes it to become a geminate
      aspirated plosive, which are pronounced in Modern Qevesa as fricatives.
    \item Roots that have /h/ in more than one position follow the rules of both positions.  These are exceedlingly rare.
  \end{itemize*}

  The patterns for soft roots are given in \cref{tab:vm_soft_roots}.

  \subsection{Weak Roots}
  \label{ssec:vm_weak_roots}

  Weak roots had /ɡ/ or /ɟ/ in one or more positions. 
  
  G-roots (roots with /ɡ/) induced the most extensive changes: when initial, it
  elided; when following a vowel, it lengthened that vowel; when following a
  consonant, it lengthened the consonant; and when between two vowels, it
  disappeared, causing adjacent transfix patterns to rearrange around the
  remaining consonants.  These roots are thus the most irregular root forms,
  often with unpredictable patterns.

  J-roots (roots with /ɟ/) tend to be less irregular, as all occurrences of /ɟ/
  weakened to the approximant /j/.  A syllable-final /j/ further weakened to the
  vowel /i/, often resulting in the appearance of /-i/ offglide diphthongs.

  The patterns for weak roots are given in \cref{tab:vm_weak_roots}.

  \subsection{Biliteral Roots}
  \label{ssec:vm_biliteral_roots}

  Whilst the overwhelming majority of roots in Qevesa are triliteral, there is
  a small closed class of true biliteral roots as opposed to the apparently
  biliteral patterns that \emph{soft} and \emph{weak} roots display.  These are
  ususally distinguishable in that they lack long vowels that were formed on
  \emph{soft} and \emph{weak} roots from the elision of consonants, though
  there are a handful of roots with apparent homonymy in some forms and
  conjugations.

  \subsection{Quadriliteral Roots}
  \label{ssec:vm_quadriliteral_roots}

  Quadriliteral roots also exist.
